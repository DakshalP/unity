            <p>
                Unity is a "gaming engine", a piece of software that lets you build and design video games.
                It's used by professionals in the gaming industry to create some of the most popular games out there. Ever wanted to move and animate your 3Ds Max models? Now you can. With Unity, you can make game worlds like real game developers do.
                Scroll on to find out how.

                    In this course, you will be using <strong>3Ds Max</strong> to make 
                    3D models, <strong>Unity</strong> to design your games, 
                    and a program called <strong>VS Code</strong> to add simple code to your games to make them work. 
                    The tutorial will explain more, but in it they use Visual Studio rather than VS Code.
