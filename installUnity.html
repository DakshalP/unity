            <h1>How to Install Unity</h1>
            <p>First go to <a target="_blank" href="https://store.unity.com/download-nuo">store.unity.com/download-nuo</a>.
                <p style="margin-top: 0; font-size: 0.7em; display: inline-block">(Or look up "download unity" on Google)</p>
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>There you will see two options, click <strong>Start here</strong></p>
            <img class="medium" src="images/install_guide/start_here.png" alt="start here">
            <p><strong>Agree and download</strong> the UnityHubSetup installer.</p>
            <img class="small" src="images/install_guide/hub_setup.png">

            <p><br>After that, run the installer by clicking on it. It will guide you through the process of installing <strong>Unity Hub</strong>, a program we will use to install Unity.
            Once you've done that, run UnityHub by clicking the checkbox before you finish (see below picture), or looking up Unity Hub in your apps.
            </p>
            <img class="small" src="images/install_guide/hub_setup_2.png" alt="click the run unity checkbox">

            <p><br>Once UnityHub is open, it will run you through the process of installing Unity.</p>
            <img class="medium" src="images/install_guide/hub_run.png">
            <p>While Unity is installing, it will ask you to create a Unity Account. Sign in with Google, and use your <strong>personal account</strong>, not your school account, so that you can get confirmation emails from Unity.</p>
            <img class="medium" src="images/install_guide/hub_run_2.png">
            <p>After that, it will ask you to select a template or "microgame", a.k.a a starting project. We'll click Empty 3D since we are going to use a tutorial to make our game from scratch.</p>
            <img class="medium" src="images/install_guide/hub_run_3.png">

            <h3><br> After that hit <strong>Launch unity</strong> to get started. When you're ready, you can move on to <a href="two.html">the video tutorials</a>.</h3>

            <p><br>If you get stuck at any time and have to close the Unity Hub, you can always just open up Unity and make a new project with it (after it has installed).</p>
